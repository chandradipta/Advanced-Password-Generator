## üîê Project Description

The **Ultimate Password Generator** is a clean, responsive, and feature-rich web application designed to create strong, secure, and fully customizable passwords right in your browser. Built using HTML, Bootstrap 5, and vanilla JavaScript ‚Äî all in a single self-contained file ‚Äî this tool empowers users to take control of their password strength and complexity with zero setup or dependencies.

With a simple, user-friendly interface, it allows you to define password length, toggle character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and apply smart filters such as avoiding similar or ambiguous characters and preventing character repetition. Every password includes at least one character from each selected type to ensure security compliance.

The app features a real-time password strength meter, clipboard copy functionality with visual confirmation, a password visibility toggle, and the ability to save generated passwords as `.txt` files. Whether you're a developer, IT admin, security-conscious individual, or just someone tired of weak passwords, this tool offers a seamless and secure solution for everyday password generation.

No installations. No ads. No trackers. Just open and generate.
